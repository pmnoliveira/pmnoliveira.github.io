                    <p>The CUVID project aims at responding to the urgent need to fight youth unemployment. The goal is to develop an interactive online talent platform for young people and link them directly to potential employers. The CUVID platform will allow young people to create videos for self-presentation that will be linked to their scanned curricula. It also aims at training teachers and students with relevant ICT skills in order to produce, edit and publish online videos.</p>

                Since we knew clearly where to go, we started to design the system around its selling points, the job offers, and the videos that were used by the seekers to promote their skills and present themselves in first person to the network of companies.

            <p class="txt-block">
                In collaboration with the project lider <a href="">Marco Beludo</a>, we began by developing an excel document that we called Content Visualization.

                This approximation applied to the first steps after we know the target set by the projects partners allowed the development team to have a confident, steady and strong start. The organization in matrix of the pages, hierarchy, content, actions and details faciliteated me as a designer to drafts quicker solutions and helped me to focus on the interface aspect of the project. As you might notice by the grid, smoothly, we've already outlined the navigation of the user. You can notice this by analising the ID, Link and Redirect columns of the table.

                For us to achieve and experience and homogenous aesthethics throughout the whole experience of the product, after the definition of content, navigation and hierarchy I've designed a style guide for us to reuse it on the project. This style guide was built on top of Ember.js</p>

                We have accomplished a homogenous and stable system capable of providing what was intended and promised to do, making it a success for all the partners and the European Program.
                Although we had a strong competition in what regards Recruiting Platforms we made a distinctible one that was focused on video and help both job seekers and recruiters to have a better engagement. We also provided a good recruitment system with custom forms and custom tags so that the companies could do most of the recruitment process of getting information from the seeker through the platform.

                Due to the large amounts of text that his platform would show in multiple screens, the danger of having a cluttered interface was very high, but in the end, I believe that we’ve achieved a good balance between content and white space leaving the users' eyes with guidance and “breathe”.An awesome aspect of being part of this project is that the development team was small in number, but we’ve learned that with good organization from step one, method all the way till the end and knowing where the target was helping us to provide a solid project with considerable size.
